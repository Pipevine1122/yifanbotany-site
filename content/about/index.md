#### **Hi,**       <!-- Medium heading -->

I’m a plant evolutionary biologist based in Manhattan, NYC, working at NYU as a lab associate in the Onyenedum Lab under Professor Joyce G. Onyenedum. My current research focuses on the microevolution of flowering plants, especially *Aristolochia* (a.k.a. the pipevine), and the transcriptomics and kinematics of an important crop, *Phaseolus vulgaris* 🫘 (the common bean you can get from Chipotle).

I’m passionate about making the wisdom of plants accessible to a wide audience by combining technology, art, and storytelling to share the beauty and wonder of the botanical world in ways that are engaging and approachable. Together with several close friends, I run a small studio creating plant-themed artwork: whether it’s a line drawing for a taxonomy paper, a methods flowchart for a research article, or a watercolor inspired by the spirit of Sir William J. R. Curtis in the 19th century, reflecting the aesthetics of creation.

Outside of research, I’m a Muay Thai fighter by night in Brooklyn and enjoy taking quick hikes to escape the city’s noise.

Feel free to contact me if you’d like to collaborate on research, commission artwork, or simply talk about plants🍃.
