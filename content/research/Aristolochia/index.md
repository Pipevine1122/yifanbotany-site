*Aristolochia*, despite its conspicuous flower morphology and astonishing ecological relationships with butterflies and pollinators, remains relatively understudied in systematics due to the difficulty of sampling.

## Introduction

*Aristolochia* is famous for its conspicuous flowers and unusual pollination biology, but the group is still patchily sampled and, as a result, systematics has lagged. Within the genus, subgenus *Siphisia* is probably the most understudied lineage. Here I build a species-level framework using a large, newly assembled molecular dataset collected across several extensive field expeditions. The goal is to resolve relationships among species and illuminate the macroevolutionary history of this clade.

## Objectives
- Generate a well-resolved phylogenomic hypothesis for *Aristolochia* subg. *Siphisia*  
- Test morphological and geographic patterns in a comparative framework  
- Provide a reproducible baseline for future taxonomic work

## Data & Methods (in progress)
- Field collections across focal regions; herbarium sampling where possible  
- High-throughput sequencing (target capture / UCEs / genome skimming as appropriate)  
- Species tree + divergence time inference; trait and biogeographic analyses
