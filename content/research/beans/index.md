The twining motion of bean plants, so common you probably see it often without noticing, remains surprisingly poorly understood. At the molecular level, it is still unclear whether, like many other kinematic movements, this motion is actively regulated by a network of gene expression, or whether it arises from more passive, self-organizing processes. To address this, I am leading a transcriptomic profiling project aimed at quantitatively capturing these movements, to better understand what enables plants to display what Charles R. Darwin once called “animal-like behaviors.”

## Introduction

Bean plants are well known for their twining stems, yet the precise mechanisms—especially at the molecular level—that drive such coordinated circumnutatory movement remain elusive. In this project, I aim to dissect the gene expression dynamics underlying twining, using high-resolution transcriptomic data collected during different stages of movement.

## Objectives
- Profile gene expression patterns across circumnutation stages in beans  
- Identify candidate regulatory pathways involved in motor region dynamics  
- Provide a molecular framework for understanding climbing plant movement

## Data & Methods (in progress)
- Time-series sampling of motor regions during twining  
- RNA-seq and differential expression analysis  
- Integration with kinematic tracking to correlate movement and expression
